           Right now I am teaching myself Rust and Vue, mostly for Size Matters.

            Size Matters is a poker planning tool for Scrum's refining sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got tired of my boss always asking if we were ready to size and counting before we threw some finger in the air.
            So I decided there has got to be a better way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I was already learning Rust, I decided to use it. I wanted to use Websockets to create a very dynamic site,
            and found a the <a href="https://github.com/actix/actix">Actix</a> actor framework that allows you to easily
            create a site that uses Websockets and actors for concurrency.
          </p>

            The UI is written in VUE using a Material Design like library.

          Project Euler has many problems that require a lot of math and
          can be algorithmically solved.

            Very similar to Project Euler, but works as an advent calendar providing a problem every day in December until Christmas.
            <br/>
            Most problems are on the easier side, compared to Project Euler, but still challenging.

            Since there are spoilers in Reddit, I decided to post my reasoning to each problem in my <a href="/category/coding">blog</a>.

          I store the parallel algorithms I write in this repository. Not much
          to see now, just an example of my code.

            Ruins and Raiders is an RPG game based on Pathfinder 1 rules. I decided to write an RPG game since I have no one to play with.
            <br/>
            The rules are being written in Rust. The idea is to first make it into a browser game, compiling the rules into WebAssembly
            and using some Rust web framework. Then step 2 is to make it into a MUD, which realisticly won't happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is on hold in favor of Size Matters.
