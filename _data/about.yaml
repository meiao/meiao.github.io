          Project Euler (PE) has many (usually) math related problems that require
          a lot of computation and can not be solved by hand (mostly). Some only
          require the computer's brute force capabilities. Other require more
          complex algorithms or math deduction, specially if you want your
          computer to resolve them in a timely manner.

          I have been solving problems on PE since after I took a
          "Programming Challenges" course in college. I stopped working on it
          for a while, but resumed recently.

          Each problem recieves a number as answer and so PE is programming
          language agnostic. I use Ruby to write the solutions.

          On my badge (below) you can see how many problems I have solved and if
          you want to add me as a friend, my key is
          "182577_c44298b6cf815eb0b9dbf1cc486573ba". I have a private Bitbucket
          repository where I store my solutions. If you would like to see them,
          contact me and I can either open the repository or send an individual
          program.

          ACM Online Judge (ACM OJ) is very similar to PE, but its problems are
          (usually) based on computer science theory instead of math.
          So in ACM OJ a different data structure may make all the difference.
        </section>
        <section>
          Another difference is that you send your code and the ACM OJ will
          compile and run your code. So it is more selective about programming
          languages. I wrote most of my solutions in ANSI C and a couple in C++.
        </section>
        <section>
          Unfortunately, I lost most of the code for my solutions. Guess I will
          have to start solving them again.
