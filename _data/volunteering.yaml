          Code for DC is a non-partisan, non-political group of volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues and help people engage with the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to participate in their project nights both to hack away some code and to also help the organizer, either by manning the door, or by carrying the pizza.
        </p>

          They have lots of projects going on in a variety of languages.

          District Housing is a project aimed to ease the filling of affordable housing forms.
          Each building has a different form, so this project has a master form with all the data usually required in the specific form.
          So a social worker can use this project to fill in a master form and with that, print out any registered specific form with the data filled in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project is written in Ruby on Rails, it integrates with google docs to retrieve the specific forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I contributed by adding an integration with OpenStreetMap to allow visualization of each buiding in a map.
          And also the ability to set a default text for a field, for instance, to allow "Not Available" to be displayed if there was no middle name for an applicant.

          Techcorridor.io is the site for a group of developers from Iowa City and Cedar Rapids, IA, (I believe) in the same vein of Code for DC.
          Once we had someone in a project night in Code for DC helping them make their site and I joined.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created their "Developers" page, which retrieved its data using Meetup's API.
          Unfortunately something has broken and the request is failing authentication.
