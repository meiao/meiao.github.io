          University of SÃ£o Paulo's newest library houses books about Brazil.
          Among its volumes there is one original copy of a book written by
          Hans Staden in 1557.

          Using Atiz and Kirtas book scanners the books are digitized for
          preservation. The preservation copies are then treated and result in
          smaller access copies which are available at their
          <a href="http://www.brasiliana.usp.br/bbd/">digital library</a>.

          My work there was to maintain the existing digital library while
          developing a new version. The new version of the library was ready by the
          time I left, but it is not up because of infrastructure problems.

          Besides that I also helped develop the work flow and intern management
          system. And since the library does not have a large team I installed
          and configured the web servers using Puppet.

          This is what I helped create at Touch Tecnologia. Unfortunately the
          video is in Portuguese only.
