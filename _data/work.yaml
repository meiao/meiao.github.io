          University of SÃ£o Paulo's newest library houses books about Brazil.
          Among its volumes there is one original copy of a book written by
          Hans Staden in 1557.
          Using specialized book scanners the books are digitized for
          preservation. The preservation copies are then treated and result in
          smaller access copies which are available at their
          <a href="https://digital.bbm.usp.br/" target="_blank">digital library</a>.

          This is what I helped create at Touch Tecnologia. Unfortunately the
          video is in Portuguese only.
